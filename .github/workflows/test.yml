#     Scope:
#       This Action is to show the
#       manipulation of the outputs from each job.
#
#     Problem Statement:
#       When using GITHUB ACTIONS Matrix it
#       was hard to persist some sort of data
#       to handle in the output/result of the run
#
#     Potential Caveats:
#       This may not work when the matrix steps
#       are run in parallel
